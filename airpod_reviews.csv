For me, I was more interested in the sound quality and battery life, and was a little disappointed. It is by no means bad, but it also isn’t anything world shattering.
I went from normal AirPods to Pros and was expecting a much more significant jump in quality. There is a noticeable jump, but it is far from the leap I was looking for. The Pros sound better, but I still find myself using my regular AirPods often because I prefer the fit of those over the larger silicon tips of the Pros. Battery life is also higher, but again, it’s more of a mild improvement than a generational leap.
They’re very solid, but not a must buy. I think for most people, the choice between AirPods and Airpod Pros will end up being personal taste, and which features and fit they prefer.",6 people found this helpful

Allison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Skeptical at first but Air pods all the way now,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 30, 2022",Verified Purchase,"I have been very happy with my new-to-me Air pods pro. I was skeptical at first about ‘buying-in’ to the Air pods brand. For a long time I loved my not-Apple brand ear buds. These are awesome, and I am so happy I made the switch. The noise cancellation is a really cool feature. I love that my music/video automatically pauses if I take one airpod out of my ear. And being able to interact with Siri and talk-to-text is just so great, as a busy mom having tech that is completely hands-free is awesome, and I don’t have to have my phone in my pocket, it could be in the next room. I went with the pros because the shape of the ear bud fits better for me. I have never liked the fit of the traditional Apple ear buds, they are not comfortable for me. These ones are a better fit, although I am still having trouble with them slipping out of my ears, and I have tried changing out the different-sized cushions. This may be a personal issue, as I have experienced the same kind of slippage with other ear buds. This product is great quality for the price. The refurbished air pods were still registered to another user when the package arrived.

Wade Crawford,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best True-Wireless Headphones,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 31, 2022",Verified Purchase,"I have never been an Apple fan but since getting the AirPod Pro's, I am committed! I have had Jaybird X2 or 3, Jabra Elite Sport, and have used normal Air Pods in the past and was satisfied but in hindsight, nothing really compares to the in-ear comfort, sound quality, and ease of use - plus the noise cancellation is impeccable! The Jaybirds weren't true wireless, the Jabra's were really big and had a bit of heft to them, the normal Air Pods were ever-so-slightly uncomfortable due to the size and they don't have noise cancellation!
Note: I have been using an iPhone for the past 2 years with an iPhone XS, prior to that I had used Android since the iPhone 5. I try to switch every few years but have heard that it works great with Android, and I can confirm that they work well with Microsoft Computers for Teams, Zoom, and similar.
One thing that I will say, get a case for them, I got a case for mine but unfortunately it didn't have the pairing hole, I used a low-power drill to carefully drill into the case and allow for pairing with a new device, without removing it from the case. (3M adhesive on the interior of the case proved near impossible to remove the case - which is a good thing I suppose!)

Alex Joy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 29, 2021",Verified Purchase,"Sound quality is average at best and hollow at worst. It’s passable for everyday usage which is what I needed however when I really truly want to listen deeply to music I wouldn’t use these. The noise canceling misses a lot the higher and louder noises/sounds. The Sony wfxm whatever’s are far and away better at both noise canceling and sound quality. The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1s are even better at sound but don’t feature noise canceling. Where the AirPod Pros beat both of them, and why I like them the most, is general ease of use. They connect instantly and when I want to go to one bud it doesn’t skip a beat. The case in the perfect size and shape for wireless earbuds. They look the best in my opinion. No one will start talking you because they couldn’t see your earbuds which is a huge deal for me! I love being able to easily see the battery life, which is a bit low but totally fine, on them when they connect too which is absent from the other mentioned buds. As far as price goes those I’d only consider buying these when they’re on sale or refurbished as for $250 they are not worth it. I purchased through Amazon renewed at $169 which I think was a great deal. For comparison the Sony’s are about $220 iirc and the Cambridge audios $99.

I love apple ipad and phones and wanted to get buds.. and the pro’s are the way to go. Let start out with the size of these.. they fit in ears better and aren’t as long so not sticking out so far. The buds go right in no falling out and they are kind of hard to get the tips off, so you won’t lose them. They give you a couple tips for sizes.
Now let’s talk about sound ..10.. nice bass and clarity and they let you hear people while listening to music, you can hear around you. But now I say this for the people that listen to music like I do, full blast, probably be deaf when I get older, but I don’t care what they say about you hear everything, NO.. so you can hear alittle when your music is full blast may a peep. But if you keep you music at medium level and are in college, you can hear your teacher talk while listen to music. Just focus.. LOL
Also, another note. Charging doc or case. It great for charging them when you are out in about. Also I some times like to use just 1 at a time due to I listen to loud music, so it charges one at a time, you don’t hav to charge both and I like how your phone state’s battery life of bud and charger/doc.",

There was also ear wax in the bottom of the holders for the ear buds. Over all I am disappointed and disgusting.

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very cheap airpods. Problems after 6 months,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 12, 2022",Verified Purchase,"They work great. And for being refurbished were a steal for high quality airpods. I got them for under $100 at the time.
But after 6 months, the right-side airpod stopped working entirely. I did some troubleshooting with Apple support. Long story short, because they were out of the Apple 1 year warranty, instead of paying for 1 replacement airpod - something like $85 - I would have to replace all 3 devices (2 airpods and the charging case) for $257. That costs more than a brand new set of Airpod Pros.
So, you get what you pay for I guess. I had some high quality Airpods for half the price for 6 months. Now I just have 1. I'll keep using it until the left-side one malfunctions. It all balances out I suppose. But next time I'll be getting them brand new and with the extended warranty.",One person found this helpful

I don't use them often so I was surprised to discover this problem so soon. Another few months of use and now I'm discovering more problems like a lot of static and the sound on the left pod going in and out. What's more surprising is the fact that I bought these to replace a cheaper pair of non-apple air pods that actually worked better. I paid Apple prices but got cheap quality. NEVER buy refurbished again. Notice they use the word RENEWED instead of refurbished in their product description. I wouldn't pay $79 for these but instead paid $179.",

Fernando,1.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED REVIEW - Decent product, horrible seller","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 2, 2021",Verified Purchase,"WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY -- The initial review was 5 stars and still holds up with regards to the product itself, but the new 1 star review is due to a few things. For starters, the initial pair of Airpods ceased to play audio on the left side, despite charging overnight and several restarts. 'No big deal, I'll send them back for a replacement', I thought. I did, and today I received a 'replacement' consisting of an EMPTY AIRPOD PRO BOX. No case, no obvious tamper protection (the initial pair had tape on the box, this had absolutely nothing so clearly someone had already rifled through it) -- absolutely pathetic showing. I purchased this refurbished pair from 'A4C Online' and would like to tell anyone looking at this review now to STAY AWAY FROM THEM. The text of the initial review has been preserved below for posterity and because I still agree that the Airpods themselves are an excellent product; but do yourself a favor and buy from someone else, specifically Apple directly if you can afford the extra cost.
-----------------------
Bought for my son to replace a pair of Airpod 1s he had for two years which stopped holding a charge on right earbud, I'll let him write this review.
'I'm typically not an Apple person. In fact, I'm literally using these on a Samsung phone. I've always taken Apple products to be shoddy or inferior to other brands, but usually more expensive due to the brand recognition. I got a pair of original Airpods for free from a friend who'd upgraded, so I figured I might as well use them. They served well for a couple years but had a lot of minor flaws that stacked up into big annoyances altogether -- major noise bleed (I could hear EVERYTHING outside my headphones if something wasn't playing), subpar battery life (about 3-4 hours? Could just be because they were used, but still), really poor build quality, unintuitive controls for playing, pausing, etc. These solve EVERY PROBLEM I had, and honestly blew my mind. The quality is a noticeable step up -- not incredible, but definitely more than you'd expect from earbuds of this size. They fit very snugly in the ears and don't fall out easily at all. The ANC noise cancellation is AMAZING, you literally can't hear any other background noises. The battery life is LONG and I'm still not sure how long it lasts, I had these on and playing for at least 3 or 4 hours and I didn't even get a low battery warning. Since we got these at a bit of a discount (roughly $168 due to these being renewed), I am absolutely 100% happy with the price to quality ratio. $200 for them direct from Apple is a bit much, but $150-$170 is a good price. You will not regret buying a pair of Airpod Pros!'",4 people found this helpful

Logan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product Arrived DEFECTIVE!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 26, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I’m quite familiar with this product, as these are my 7th pair. (My job causes me to lose/ leave my airpods all the time.)
However, this is the first time I’ve ever purchased a used/refurbished/ renewed pair. But since I lose them all the time, I thought it may be a cost effective option for me. Unfortunately, my device was defective out of the box!
**Story Time**
My Airpods Pro didn’t come with all of the materials that come in the original box and the charger I received [packaged separately] was not even an apple brand. This didn’t bother me much, as I have more than enough accessories for this item.
The device itself appeared clean and undamaged. When I opened the device to check the battery status, it was dead [Apple has a policy of not sending their devices fully charged for shipping safety reasons, so I assumed the previous owner received the item new and returned them without charging it more].
I connected the airpods to my OFFICIAL Apple charger from a previous device and the battery light immediately glowed green. Confused, I then proceeded to pair it to my phone. The first attempt was successful. I checked my battery notification screen on my iPhone and the airpods case displayed a full 100% charge, yet the airpods themselves were each dead at 1%. After a few seconds of charge, they reached 7% [charging speed rare, but not completely unheard of], so I took the case off the charger and went to test out the sound quality.
As soon as I took an earpiece out- the entire device went off. The case and pods still read as charging on my phone even though I had removed them from charging moments before. I could not find the devise in my drop menu, so I went into settings to manually pair the AirPods again- but they wouldn’t sync. After 4/5 times connecting and forgetting device, I attempted to reattach the charger- NOW the AirPods case is on 0% but the earpieces are both on 13% 🙄. As soon as I plug them back in, the airpods sync again and I am able to hear the pairing chime on my earpiece. SECONDS LATER the airpods die and the phone shows they are on 0% *charging* WHILE they are still in my ears!
Like I said, I’ve had a ton of airpods, I know how to troubleshoot most any problem they give me. I’ve never had to deal with this kind of headache before- ESPECIALLY on day 1. I’m so over it! I’m going to an Apple store first thing in the morning. This was a horrible experience.",7 people found this helpful

Stephanie L,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why pay full price when you can get these?!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 3, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I’ve been debating the purchase of AirPods for awhile.
I have a $30 pair of wireless earbuds that work great and have decent battery life, so why?
Well, I enjoy my Apple products and then my daughter got a pair of AirPods for her birthday. I used them one day and I really liked them.
I started to look into the AirPods Pro and then the price jumped up.
So when I came across the refurbished product, I figured I’d give it a shot.
I received the product with plastic on it and all of the original accessories packaged, seemingly untouched.
So glad I didn’t pay full price! Love a deal.
I like the noise canceling option, something my beloved $30 pair doesn’t offer, along with the spacial audio and transparency option.
Battery life has been great so far.
The different sized ear buds are handy and I’m still figuring out all the things the AirPods can do when paired with my iPhone.
I’d definitely buy again.",2 people found this helpful

Dylan Sturgis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't let the scary stories in the reviews here dissuade you too much.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 20, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I was honestly concerned, seeing the reviews here, about what I'd get when the product arrived. Lotta horror stories about buzzing noises or otherwise non-functioning earbuds.
My experience? I paid $30 less, and aside from minor cosmetic defects on the case, they're absolutely flawless. All the features that I wanted to work, work (even with an Android phone, no less) -- Wireless charging, active noise cancellation, transparency mode, the whole nine yards. They're earbuds, so they're not exactly studio monitor quality when it comes to sound, but the sound is clear and detailed enough for 95% of listeners, and isn't too heavy on bass or too thin.
For $30? Yeah, I can deal with a couple scuff marks. It's a piece of technology to be used and enjoyed, not a fashion statement. Totally recommend buying these in lieu of a brand new set, and even on the off-chance you do get a dud, Amazon's return policy is kick-ass.",17 people found this helpful

Bernard K Hurley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t purchase ‘Renewed’ AirPods,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 12, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I listen to podcasts and audiobooks. As such, I’ve purchased many earbuds over the last 10 years, most of which were < $100. Wanting a durable earbud with good audio (particularly for making / receiving calls), I finally chose the Apple pro. To save money I chose a ‘Renewed’ Apple product.
I made my purchase on Nov 19, and have been very content with the quality - so much so that I decided to order another pair for my wife on Dec 8. However, on Dec 9 I began having connection problems with my earbuds. So I decided to do what I sometimes do with Amazon, I decided to exchange. This is when I discovered the pitfalls of buying a ‘Renewed’ Apple product.
First, unlike most Amazon purchases, there is no return / exchange option for renewed Apple EarPods. There is, however, bureaucracy. After a closer look at my options and an hour on the phone with Amazon and Apple, I discovered that my earbud warranty (with the vender) expired on Dec 10. My only option was to send the buds to Apple for repair.
I immediately decided to cancel my second Amazon (earbud) order. However, just like my first order, there was no cancel option for the second earbuds. They were in the mail. I received them the next day.
At this time I have initiated returns through customer service and I’m waiting for follow up via Amazon. I will modify this review accordingly.
The lesson, if you want Apple EarPods, buy new.",

I've always been happy with Apple products. I use these at work to listen to music and cancel out the sound around me so I can focus on my reporting. I paid a little more and bought these Pro earbuds after reading other reviews and because of their noise cancelling. The lack of wires makes it easier to walk around and keep them in my ears.

outofethers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dirty and noise transparency does not work,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 6, 2021",Verified Purchase,"So I was willing to give these a shot because of the money I’d save compared to buying new ones.
The first pair I got was nasty. The case was so scuffed and dirty, opening the case and looking at the buds you could see ear wax inside the tips. Really, really gross. Definitely not “good” condition and definitely not worth the 192 dollar price tag. Nevertheless, I cleaned them with some isopropyl to give them a shot. They paired to my phone pretty seamlessly, as I’d expect from owning the 1st generation AirPods for years. The sound was good, but the advanced sound features did not work. You could not tell a difference when in noise suppression or noise transparency to even just having the features off. No difference at all. So I requested an exchange and sent that pair back.
Second pair was in a lot better shape than the first ones I was sent, so that was nice. Although the earbud tips still had earwax in them (seriously amazon, the least you could do is clean the damn used products you’re trying to resell). Anyway, same as the first set, they paired to my phone with no problems and the sound in them was fine. Still tho, none of the advanced sound features work. Again, I could not tell the difference between noise suppression, noise transparency or the features being off altogether. I’m sure it’s not my phone either, as I tried pairing them to my girlfriends phone as well, with the same results.
In the end, I requested to return for a full refund and I would rate the overall experience a 1/5 because of the gross ear tips and the exceptionally poor shape of the first pairs case.
If you’re planning to buy used from Amazon warehouse, just be aware that you may be getting a product in way worst condition than what’s advertised, with somebody else’s earwax in the AirPod tips and with critical features that don’t work. Which is probably why the original owner ended up selling them anyway.",2 people found this helpful

The only way to remove this, per Apple, is to have the OWNER remove their email from the airpods. Of course, this should have been handled prior to shipping this to anyone else. As soon as I connected the airpods to my iphone, the original owner had my location. I promptly called Apple to correct this and was notified it had to be done prior to sending the AirPods and the only person who could remove is the owner. THey advised me to turn it off immediately, disconnect it from my icloud, and send it back to Amazon as there is no way to stop it from sharing with the previous owner.
I am VERY disappointed by this oversight as this is a HUGE safety concern. Who knows who I shared my homes address with. So disappointed in this. Beyond disappointed actually.
Prior to sending this out, there needs to be more care taken to completely remove the original owner. They HAD to have gotten the same notification I did when they connected these AirPods to another device to test prior to sending. To send it out anyway is irresponsible and dangerous. It's a tracking device for God's sake.

My Airpods have issues connecting to my phone when I put them in my ears (when they are already connected). One of the airpods will connect and the other will act as if it's not in my ears at all.
Recently, I've had issues with the airpods humming. One of the airpods will connect correctly and the other started humming in my ear and not playing any sound from my phone. Now that same airpod is lower in sound volume than the other. Overall some pretty terrible luck with these renewed airpods. I'd recommend just buying a brand new pair from Costco for $200 bucks instead of playing your luck with the renewed items.",One person found this helpful

Battery life could be better but using the case to recharge it will last at least 1-2 days depending of usage.

Performed reset options on Apple website, nothing works. Product advertised as amazon tested and renewed. Seller questions suggest having Apple fix them at a repair location. I find this a ridiculous request to customers, would not paid the price for broken Apple AirPod pro. They do appear to be genuine Apple product. All S/N match.

On the video I posted i'm trying to replicate the ear cannal with my hands so you guys can listen the high frecuency sound.
I'm starting the refund process but honestly It's kinda rare, since renewed products supossedly are tested, cleaned, and other stuff... well this was not the case.
On top of that... I have to pay to send the item back to amazon... even if amazon refund the amount honestly it's just bad experience...
I guess that brand new airpods are great and all, maybe I had bad luck.

Emily,1.0 out of 5 stars,Active Noise Cancellation not working,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 5, 2021",Verified Purchase,"The left AirPod fit in my left ear easily but the right AirPod did not. Once I was able to get it in, the left AirPod recognized it was in an ear, but the right AirPod did not recognize it was in an ear - the active noise cancelling mode will not work if the Airpods aren’t registering they are both in your ears.
I reached out to the seller to return and it’s been 5 days with no response - previously, a return of this item was free and now the return costs $4.50. It’s not a huge amount of money but it’s enough to make me reach out to the seller and ask why it now costs $4.50 to return an item when it was previously free to make a return?

I charged and tried them (cringing at actually putting them in my ears, because ew) although I knew already I would return just to add info to this review. Even without the functional problem, these should not be sold as refurb's just with the extent of cosmetic damage. It looks as though a dog/cat or baby chewed on the AirPods themselves.

Order ended up coming from ""Bargain Pc"". I'm refunding it. Nobody should ever consider business with them.

Outrageous price for renewed AirPod pros when you can get a brand new pair for under 130$. Also, how when these were renewed new audio supplements were put into the earbud. Not the original apple audio product but after market price of once again that maybe cost you 15$ to buy and build.

The battery life is 10/10 I can use my air pods for days and not need to charge them after every use.

Y.Reid,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t believe these weren’t brand new,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 7, 2021",Verified Purchase,"Really glad I got these, my favourite thing about AirPods is how quickly it takes to get from not listening to music to listening to music. These specific model I couldn’t tell these were refurbished to be honest! They are clean and work perfectly and I have yet to kill the battery. I love it. I think I expected a bit more from the noise cancelling though but this is my first ever noise canceling device and I think I may need to try a different tip fit in my left ear versus my right ear. Or maybe a comply foam tip for a different fit. As sometimes the fit is a bit loser than the original AirPods we’re. But don’t get me wrong I used these on a plane and it was a much better experience than the AirPods one",

If you’re skeptical about ordering these “Renewed” Airpod Pros, DON’T BE! I ordered these and got them delivered the same day! Very well packaged, and came with all of the accessories that would come in a sealed box. Very minimal scratches, can’t even tell really. And they were very clean, almost brand new! Definitely worth it. That’s my two cents.",
Blivits,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost too comfortable,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 26, 2021",Verified Purchase,Took a chance on some refurbished AirPods. So far they have lived up to my expectations as an Apple product. They have been easy to use and the connect quickly no matter what implement I use. The only thing I don’t like about them is I forget that they are in my ears.. lol surely not a fault but they have nearly gone swimming with me a couple of times.. if you have never had real Airpods in your ears you are in for a treat.. enjoy,

All features work perfectly, paid $30 less for the same product just not brand new! I would highly recommend this product from this seller!",

So when they came out with the Pro version I knew I wasn't the only one wanting a few changes, different sized ear tips chief among them. These are so much better fitting/sounding than the original its incredible, I am not really a fan of the squeeze technic vs simply tapping but we'll see maybe that'll grow on me. If only Apple brought their manufacturing here to the USA thats the number 1 improvement needed at this point, but unlikely as of 2021...
Update 2022, they are great! The squeeze is ok, I'd still rather have the tap but, whatever. Sound is very good, battery life is incredible considering how small they must be.",

Tessa M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost Perfect!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 4, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I bought these refurbished Airpod Pros from the seller ""Certified Pre-Owned Computers"". I highly suggest you check the reviews for the seller you buy refurbished products from!! The Airpods Pros I purchased from this seller came in the original Apple box, with the Airpods case, Airpod Pros, lightning charging cable and the extra ear tips along with the Apple paperwork with no Apple stickers. I immediately checked to see if the serial numbers on the box and on the inside of the Airpods case matched up, and went to the Apple website to check if the serial number was actually authentic Apple Airpods. Good news: they ARE REAL Apple Airpod Pros! (There are A LOT of fake Airpods out there, so be careful!) The condition of the Airpod Pros and case were clean and almost like new. There is a very small tiny scratch on the side of the Airpods case, but it's very hard to see and basically unnoticeable. Other than that small blemish, the Airpods themselves work perfectly. All the batteries charge fully, and seem to last as long as they should. The firmware is up-to-date. The only downside to my purchase was that my package did not contain the SMALL Apple ear tips; instead I got 2 pairs of large ear tips and one pair of medium sized ear tips. Very unfortunate, but the medium work decent enough for me. Overall, besides the missing small ear tips, I'm very satisfied with the sound and function of my like-new Airpods Pros!",8 people found this helpful
Melissa Harris,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy from this company,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 26, 2021",Verified Purchase,They sent me a pair of earbuds that didn’t even work at all. The sound was horrible with so much feedback. They wouldn’t even connect to my iPhone. When they did manage to connect it would only be for a few minutes. The case wouldn’t even pair. I bought another pair of “renewed” earbuds from a different seller and they came packaged beautifully with a charger included. These came in a ziploc bag with no charger. When I contacted them to have these things replaced they told me to go to the Apple store. So I did. Now the Apple store has had these earbuds for the past 2 weeks and they are still “diagnosing” them because when I was in store they failed every diagnostic test they ran so they had to send them off. Bought them almost a month ago and I still don’t have my earbuds just because this seller sold me a garbage product and then refused to just exchange them for a pair that works.,

Martin Garcia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked after getting a replacement,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 30, 2021",Verified Purchase,"Update:
I decided to get a replacement and I sent back the faulty ones. They work great.
Old review:
I waited for a couple days to use a faulty product. That’s quite frustrating.
They’re clean and actually shiny. Yay.
Left AirPod charges whenever it wants to, but both AirPods won’t charge unless the case is being actively charged regardless of case percentage.
Case is faulty and opens and closes properly every other time.
Bluetooth has trouble connecting to iPhone in the sense that it connects yet doesn’t show up anywhere — nowhere to be seen in batteries widget nor connected devices after the >initial connection<, yet shows up as connected in Bluetooth settings. It doesn’t play the audio on AirPods, it actually has trouble connecting and makes your audio apps lag for some ungodly reason.
They show up on airplay but won’t connect.
Battery isn’t that great either, only lasts you 2-3 hours (mainly because it doesn’t even charge all the way without disconnecting.)
They sound “ok”.
They’ve been delivered for 4 hours and never worked properly.",2 people found this helpful

The only problem I have is that the refurbished airpods pro is not value for money. I can only get a maximum of 2.5 - 3 hrs of battery life before I need to charge again. This is not great, especially because I can pay $60 more and get 3x battery life on a brand new pair of original Airpods pro 2!!
If I am willing to splurge $271 for a refurbished product with such limited battery life, I might as well buy a brand-new pair of Airpods directly from Apple. I will be returning this product.

Llegaron en un día y medio, el reparto me pidió el código de seguridad, sobre el producto llegaron en una cajita blanca genérica, dentro venía todo muy bien protegido en una especie de papel de espuma, contenía los audífonos, el estuche de carga y las almohadillas, NO traía cable pero en lo personal no lo necesito por lo que no me molesta pero si deberían indicar si lo incluye o no. Los audífonos y todo lo que contenía parecen nuevos, no tienen ni un rasguño, lo único que no me gusto es que no tenían carga, pero, lo que me encantó fue que al revisar la vigencia de AppleCare descubrí que tenía cobertura de AppleCare+ por medio año. En lo personal recomiendo mucho este producto.",2 people found this helpful

Solo hay dos detalles que me parecen importantes mencionarlos, el ensamblaje se nota, pero, he leído en varios blogs que los que están ensamblados en Vietnam no son los mejores ensamblajes, pero no afecta en nada el funcionamiento y solo se nota si los observas muy a detalle a una distancia tal vez de 5cm y la otra es que la caja de carga solo los carga al rededor de 3-4 veces de 0% a 100% de batería.

En mi caso todo bien, llego con una caja oficial de Apple y al verificar aún tenían una garantía de 6 meses, por lo que el tiempo de uso era realmente poco. Estéticamente los audífonos estaban increíbles, muy cuidados, de cualquier manera yo los limpie apenas los recibí por temas de higiene personal. La calidad de sonido y el audio espacial es impresionante, es por lo que quería estos Airpdos. Tengo también los AirPods 2 que adoro pero no cuentan con esta tecnología. Pero no todo podía ser bueno, me fallaron en lo que es un 90 % más importante para mi, la comodidad cosa totalmente subjetiva pero en mi caso fue imposible sentirme cómodo con ellos, las gomas lastimaban mis oídos y al final solo podía tenerlos entre 1 hora al día y ya. Me quedare con mis Aipords 2, que si siento cómodos y que a veces olvido que tengo puestos. Así que los recomiendo como compra, claro que si, se van a ahorrar un buen de dinero por un gran producto.

El estuche de carga no estaba envuelto pero si en perfecto estado, sin rayones, cada AirPod venía sin señales de uso y totalmente limpios.
