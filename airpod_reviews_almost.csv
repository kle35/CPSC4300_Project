Katie,4,Love these Headphones,United States,1,"I bought these headphones last year and they have worked great ever since I have gotten them. Their noise cancellation is great and you can't hear anything after you switch it on. The sound quality and battery life is also really great. The only thing that I don't like is there is a notification on my phone about the headphones following me when I own them. I did figure out how to turn it off but that is the only thing that I didn't like. Other than that minor inconvenience, the headphones are amazing.",6,2023-02-02,1
Sean Connolly,4,Solid,United States,1,"The noise cancellation feature is very cool, and for people that are looking for that as a main feature in their earbuds, I think they’ll be thrilled.
For me, I was more interested in the sound quality and battery life, and was a little disappointed. It is by no means bad, but it also isn’t anything world shattering.
I went from normal AirPods to Pros and was expecting a much more significant jump in quality. There is a noticeable jump, but it is far from the leap I was looking for. The Pros sound better, but I still find myself using my regular AirPods often because I prefer the fit of those over the larger silicon tips of the Pros. Battery life is also higher, but again, it’s more of a mild improvement than a generational leap.
They’re very solid, but not a must buy. I think for most people, the choice between AirPods and Airpod Pros will end up being personal taste, and which features and fit they prefer.",6,2022-12-12,1
Michelle,5,BUY IT RN,United States,1,i was a little bit skeptical at first because i had never bought a refurbished apple product before but i didnt want to spend the almost $300 when i could get it for $150ish. it shipped really really fast like i literally got it 2 days after i bought it and i didnt even pay for the expedited shipping. The noise cancellation works perfectly and the airpods are in perfect condition and it even came in the original box so you could totally gift these to someone else. The only thing tho that i didnt like was that when you try to connect it to your find my iphone app it says that there's a part missing which is prohibiting it from connecting but that's honestly the only thing wrong with it.,7,2023-01-17,1

Kiki,4,Ensure both are working properly,United States,1,"The seller is fantastic and resolved my concerns. Removing a star for the following:
The right AirPod upon receipt was not working as expected. The sound quality was terrible, it sounded crackly, as if something was loose inside.

brendan,4,"good, but cant use noise cancellation or transparency",United States,1,"Got these to go to the gym and stop dealing with the constraints of a wire. They work great for that but they didn't come out of the box perfect. The left AirPod has a clicking sound that comes on whenever I try noise cancellation or transparency. The right one is perfectly fine. Luckily, they're not features I NEED but it would've been nice if they worked how they're supposed to. I tried to get help for issue from the Internet and then Amazon's Product Support, who suggested the same things I already did and then sent me to message the seller. I tried to ask about the warranty to the seller but they sent me back to Amazon support. So whatever, I will deal. I still like them.",14,2022-09-23,1
Trust Me,4,Overall good but earpiece broken,United States,1,I love my AirPods with their noise cancelation. Always nice to sit and read a book in a noisy coffee shop and block out all the distractions with my music.

Allison,5,Skeptical at first but Air pods all the way now,United States,1,"I have been very happy with my new-to-me Air pods pro. I was skeptical at first about ‘buying-in’ to the Air pods brand. For a long time I loved my not-Apple brand ear buds. These are awesome, and I am so happy I made the switch. The noise cancellation is a really cool feature. I love that my music/video automatically pauses if I take one airpod out of my ear. And being able to interact with Siri and talk-to-text is just so great, as a busy mom having tech that is completely hands-free is awesome, and I don’t have to have my phone in my pocket, it could be in the next room. I went with the pros because the shape of the ear bud fits better for me. I have never liked the fit of the traditional Apple ear buds, they are not comfortable for me. These ones are a better fit, although I am still having trouble with them slipping out of my ears, and I have tried changing out the different-sized cushions. This may be a personal issue, as I have experienced the same kind of slippage with other ear buds. This product is great quality for the price. The refurbished air pods were still registered to another user when the package arrived. However, my husband was able to look up how to do a factory reset, and that resolved the issue easily in minutes.",24,2022-07-30,1

Kamahana,3,Hard to find if lost or stolen!,United States,1,I love this airpod pro so much this is my third time buying them as they have been stolen from me twice. I really wish “findmy” would cause it to make a louder sound when lost. It’s pretty much impossible to tell where the find my signal is coming from so don’t count on being able to find it supposing it was in your ear’s hearing vicinity and not altogether stolen and taken beyond somewhere else. Yes I bought these three times because they are so good BUT I am giving it only 3 stars because the findmy feature for this sucks large bitter lollipops.,0,2022-12-06,0
500 pc,4,Almost good,United States,1,"Bought it Amazon renewed, came in the original box and everything with the type c to lighting port and manual. However the actual AirPods case just wouldn’t hold a charge or charge at all , tried different chargers but nothing worked . I even asked a coworker and I managed to use their case to test the actual earbuds and they worked but they’re pretty useless without the case . So after work I’m definitely returning them and buying new ones since the price difference isn’t that high.",1,2022-08-05,1
Wade Crawford,5,Best True-Wireless Headphones,United States,1,"I have never been an Apple fan but since getting the AirPod Pro's, I am committed! I have had Jaybird X2 or 3, Jabra Elite Sport, and have used normal Air Pods in the past and was satisfied but in hindsight, nothing really compares to the in-ear comfort, sound quality, and ease of use - plus the noise cancellation is impeccable! The Jaybirds weren't true wireless, the Jabra's were really big and had a bit of heft to them, the normal Air Pods were ever-so-slightly uncomfortable due to the size and they don't have noise cancellation!
Note: I have been using an iPhone for the past 2 years with an iPhone XS, prior to that I had used Android since the iPhone 5. I try to switch every few years but have heard that it works great with Android, and I can confirm that they work well with Microsoft Computers for Teams, Zoom, and similar.
One thing that I will say, get a case for them, I got a case for mine but unfortunately it didn't have the pairing hole, I used a low-power drill to carefully drill into the case and allow for pairing with a new device, without removing it from the case. (3M adhesive on the interior of the case proved near impossible to remove the case - which is a good thing I suppose!) If you do get a case, either ensure that it has a hole for that, or do-it-yourself to save yourself a headache and time down the road!",1,2022-03-31,1
Kaylee Hupp,5,Disappointed,United States,1,"They came super quick! But when I received them one did not connect with my phone. The right one connected and played music but was static, the leg time did not play at all. I tried to return them and wasn’t able to. Thankfully whoever had them before me had a warranty on them so we were able to take them to Best Buy and get them fixed. Just kinda bummed that I spent a decent amount in them and they didn’t work properly. Thankfully they are able to fix them. So good and bad review!",6,2022-10-31,1
Alex Joy,4,Pretty good!,United States,1,"Sound quality is average at best and hollow at worst. It’s passable for everyday usage which is what I needed however when I really truly want to listen deeply to music I wouldn’t use these. The noise canceling misses a lot the higher and louder noises/sounds. The Sony wfxm whatever’s are far and away better at both noise canceling and sound quality. The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1s are even better at sound but don’t feature noise canceling. Where the AirPod Pros beat both of them, and why I like them the most, is general ease of use. They connect instantly and when I want to go to one bud it doesn’t skip a beat. The case in the perfect size and shape for wireless earbuds. They look the best in my opinion. No one will start talking you because they couldn’t see your earbuds which is a huge deal for me! I love being able to easily see the battery life, which is a bit low but totally fine, on them when they connect too which is absent from the other mentioned buds. As far as price goes those I’d only consider buying these when they’re on sale or refurbished as for $250 they are not worth it. I purchased through Amazon renewed at $169 which I think was a great deal. For comparison the Sony’s are about $220 iirc and the Cambridge audios $99. All in all if you just need a convenient okay bud and don’t mind the price these are it.",0,2021-05-29,1

Gina,5,Great fit and size and sound,United States,1,"So I was nervous buying renewed apple. I love apple ipad and phones and wanted to get buds.. and the pro’s are the way to go. Let start out with the size of these.. they fit in ears better and aren’t as long so not sticking out so far. The buds go right in no falling out and they are kind of hard to get the tips off, so you won’t lose them. They give you a couple tips for sizes.
Now let’s talk about sound ..10.. nice bass and clarity and they let you hear people while listening to music, you can hear around you. But now I say this for the people that listen to music like I do, full blast, probably be deaf when I get older, but I don’t care what they say about you hear everything, NO.. so you can hear alittle when your music is full blast may a peep. But if you keep you music at medium level and are in college, you can hear your teacher talk while listen to music. Just focus.. LOL
Also, another note. Charging doc or case. It great for charging them when you are out in about. Also I some times like to use just 1 at a time due to I listen to loud music, so it charges one at a time, you don’t hav to charge both and I like how your phone state’s battery life of bud and charger/doc.",0,2021-05-13,1

Skyler Beatty,5,Money well spent,United States,1,"I was hesitant to purchase the AirPod Pros at first, but as soon I as began to use them, I realized it was a worthy investment.

I will put them in my ears and turn on a song, and it makes me feel like I am in a movie. They help to put my mind at ease and unwind. The noise-cancelling feature is mind-boggling given the size and comfort compared to other noise-cancelling headphones. I have shown my grandparents, and they were in awe of the quality of sound and comfort. Additionally, the case is practical to carry with me and the battery life to time charging ratio makes them readily avaliable to use.",0,2022-05-13,1

Dylan,3,Not clean,United States,1,Over all the air pods work definitely I got them renewed in “excellent” quality. When I order that I expect to barely be able to tell that they have been out of the box before or maybe have been used one or twice. When I got mine the first thing I noticed was the outside was sticky. As if there was an adhesive from a previous sticker. That was annoying definitely but the worst part was when I opened the air pods and looked at one and inside the ear bud there was ear wax…. There was also ear wax in the bottom of the holders for the ear buds. Over all I am disappointed and disgusting. I did a deep clean myself and I hope no one else has to clean out strangers ear wax.,2,2022-08-09,0
Amazon Customer,3,Very cheap airpods. Problems after 6 months,United States,1,"They work great. And for being refurbished were a steal for high quality airpods. I got them for under $100 at the time.
But after 6 months, the right-side airpod stopped working entirely. I did some troubleshooting with Apple support. Long story short, because they were out of the Apple 1 year warranty, instead of paying for 1 replacement airpod - something like $85 - I would have to replace all 3 devices (2 airpods and the charging case) for $257. That costs more than a brand new set of Airpod Pros.
So, you get what you pay for I guess. I had some high quality Airpods for half the price for 6 months. Now I just have 1. I'll keep using it until the left-side one malfunctions. It all balances out I suppose. But next time I'll be getting them brand new and with the extended warranty.",1,2022-07-12,0

I don't use them often so I was surprised to discover this problem so soon. Another few months of use and now I'm discovering more problems like a lot of static and the sound on the left pod going in and out. What's more surprising is the fact that I bought these to replace a cheaper pair of non-apple air pods that actually worked better. I paid Apple prices but got cheap quality. NEVER buy refurbished again. Notice they use the word RENEWED instead of refurbished in their product description. I wouldn't pay $79 for these but instead paid $179.",0,2022-12-18,0

Fernando,1,"UPDATED REVIEW - Decent product, horrible seller",United States,1,"WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY -- The initial review was 5 stars and still holds up with regards to the product itself, but the new 1 star review is due to a few things. For starters, the initial pair of Airpods ceased to play audio on the left side, despite charging overnight and several restarts. 'No big deal, I'll send them back for a replacement', I thought. I did, and today I received a 'replacement' consisting of an EMPTY AIRPOD PRO BOX. No case, no obvious tamper protection (the initial pair had tape on the box, this had absolutely nothing so clearly someone had already rifled through it) -- absolutely pathetic showing. I purchased this refurbished pair from 'A4C Online' and would like to tell anyone looking at this review now to STAY AWAY FROM THEM. The text of the initial review has been preserved below for posterity and because I still agree that the Airpods themselves are an excellent product; but do yourself a favor and buy from someone else, specifically Apple directly if you can afford the extra cost.
-----------------------
Bought for my son to replace a pair of Airpod 1s he had for two years which stopped holding a charge on right earbud, I'll let him write this review.
'I'm typically not an Apple person. In fact, I'm literally using these on a Samsung phone. I've always taken Apple products to be shoddy or inferior to other brands, but usually more expensive due to the brand recognition. I got a pair of original Airpods for free from a friend who'd upgraded, so I figured I might as well use them. They served well for a couple years but had a lot of minor flaws that stacked up into big annoyances altogether -- major noise bleed (I could hear EVERYTHING outside my headphones if something wasn't playing), subpar battery life (about 3-4 hours? Could just be because they were used, but still), really poor build quality, unintuitive controls for playing, pausing, etc. These solve EVERY PROBLEM I had, and honestly blew my mind. The quality is a noticeable step up -- not incredible, but definitely more than you'd expect from earbuds of this size. They fit very snugly in the ears and don't fall out easily at all. The ANC noise cancellation is AMAZING, you literally can't hear any other background noises. The battery life is LONG and I'm still not sure how long it lasts, I had these on and playing for at least 3 or 4 hours and I didn't even get a low battery warning. Since we got these at a bit of a discount (roughly $168 due to these being renewed), I am absolutely 100% happy with the price to quality ratio. $200 for them direct from Apple is a bit much, but $150-$170 is a good price. You will not regret buying a pair of Airpod Pros!'",4,2021-10-02,0

Logan,1,Product Arrived DEFECTIVE!,United States,1,"I’m quite familiar with this product, as these are my 7th pair. (My job causes me to lose/ leave my airpods all the time.)
However, this is the first time I’ve ever purchased a used/refurbished/ renewed pair. But since I lose them all the time, I thought it may be a cost effective option for me. Unfortunately, my device was defective out of the box!
**Story Time**
My Airpods Pro didn’t come with all of the materials that come in the original box and the charger I received [packaged separately] was not even an apple brand. This didn’t bother me much, as I have more than enough accessories for this item.
The device itself appeared clean and undamaged. When I opened the device to check the battery status, it was dead [Apple has a policy of not sending their devices fully charged for shipping safety reasons, so I assumed the previous owner received the item new and returned them without charging it more].
I connected the airpods to my OFFICIAL Apple charger from a previous device and the battery light immediately glowed green. Confused, I then proceeded to pair it to my phone. The first attempt was successful. I checked my battery notification screen on my iPhone and the airpods case displayed a full 100% charge, yet the airpods themselves were each dead at 1%. After a few seconds of charge, they reached 7% [charging speed rare, but not completely unheard of], so I took the case off the charger and went to test out the sound quality.
As soon as I took an earpiece out- the entire device went off. The case and pods still read as charging on my phone even though I had removed them from charging moments before. I could not find the devise in my drop menu, so I went into settings to manually pair the AirPods again- but they wouldn’t sync. After 4/5 times connecting and forgetting device, I attempted to reattach the charger- NOW the AirPods case is on 0% but the earpieces are both on 13% 🙄. As soon as I plug them back in, the airpods sync again and I am able to hear the pairing chime on my earpiece. SECONDS LATER the airpods die and the phone shows they are on 0% *charging* WHILE they are still in my ears!
Like I said, I’ve had a ton of airpods, I know how to troubleshoot most any problem they give me. I’ve never had to deal with this kind of headache before- ESPECIALLY on day 1. I’m so over it! I’m going to an Apple store first thing in the morning. This was a horrible experience.",7,2021-09-26,0

Wasn’t a huge deal that the location services clearly weren’t accurate…until i misplaced one of them. And now it’s telling me the one I’ve lost is in the middle of a highway where it clearly is not and I have no way of knowing where I actually lost it. Very frustrating given how much I spent on these and the fact that they’re supposed to have such great ability to be tracked if lost.

I have a $30 pair of wireless earbuds that work great and have decent battery life, so why?
Well, I enjoy my Apple products and then my daughter got a pair of AirPods for her birthday. I used them one day and I really liked them.
I started to look into the AirPods Pro and then the price jumped up.
So when I came across the refurbished product, I figured I’d give it a shot.
I received the product with plastic on it and all of the original accessories packaged, seemingly untouched.
So glad I didn’t pay full price! Love a deal.
I like the noise canceling option, something my beloved $30 pair doesn’t offer, along with the spacial audio and transparency option.

All the features that I wanted to work, work (even with an Android phone, no less) -- Wireless charging, active noise cancellation, transparency mode, the whole nine yards. They're earbuds, so they're not exactly studio monitor quality when it comes to sound, but the sound is clear and detailed enough for 95% of listeners, and isn't too heavy on bass or too thin.
For $30? Yeah, I can deal with a couple scuff marks. It's a piece of technology to be used and enjoyed, not a fashion statement. Totally recommend buying these in lieu of a brand new set, and even on the off-chance you do get a dud, Amazon's return policy is kick-ass.",17,2021-05-20,1

Bernard K Hurley,2,Don’t purchase ‘Renewed’ AirPods,United States,1,"I listen to podcasts and audiobooks. As such, I’ve purchased many earbuds over the last 10 years, most of which were < $100. Wanting a durable earbud with good audio (particularly for making / receiving calls), I finally chose the Apple pro. To save money I chose a ‘Renewed’ Apple product.
I made my purchase on Nov 19, and have been very content with the quality - so much so that I decided to order another pair for my wife on Dec 8. However, on Dec 9 I began having connection problems with my earbuds. So I decided to do what I sometimes do with Amazon, I decided to exchange. This is when I discovered the pitfalls of buying a ‘Renewed’ Apple product.
First, unlike most Amazon purchases, there is no return / exchange option for renewed Apple EarPods. There is, however, bureaucracy. After a closer look at my options and an hour on the phone with Amazon and Apple, I discovered that my earbud warranty (with the vender) expired on Dec 10. My only option was to send the buds to Apple for repair.
I immediately decided to cancel my second Amazon (earbud) order. However, just like my first order, there was no cancel option for the second earbuds. They were in the mail. I received them the next day.

shopaholicme,5,Looks and feels NEW,United States,1,"I have yet to have a problem with any products I buy renewed by Amazon. I made sure I purchased from Amazon and shipped from Amazon. They came in original box and look and feel new. I have the charger,instruction book, and everything looks new! I was able to pair it with my phone and computer. It took a bit to pair even though my iphone recognized my airpods. I just turned on and off the blue tooth and now it's like nothing. I received these in one day and i am also using them as we speak with my air mac computer and they paired easily via sound and turning on bluetooth. The sound is clear and I am loving them. So glad I got them renewed and with a discount with my credit card.. I couldn't pass these up.",0,2021-06-03,1

Andrea R,5,Great sound - worth the price,United States,1,"I've had these ""refurbished"" wireless earbuds for about 8 months and they are worth the price. I haven't had any issues with them, which makes me think they were bought and returned and not refurbished in any way. I'm glad I bought these instead of paying full price for the same product. I've always been happy with Apple products. I use these at work to listen to music and cancel out the sound around me so I can focus on my reporting. I paid a little more and bought these Pro earbuds after reading other reviews and because of their noise cancelling. The lack of wires makes it easier to walk around and keep them in my ears. They have a great battery life too. I only have to charge them every couple of days or so.",0,2021-07-14,1

outofethers,1,Dirty and noise transparency does not work,United States,1,"So I was willing to give these a shot because of the money I’d save compared to buying new ones.
The first pair I got was nasty. The case was so scuffed and dirty, opening the case and looking at the buds you could see ear wax inside the tips. Really, really gross. Definitely not “good” condition and definitely not worth the 192 dollar price tag. Nevertheless, I cleaned them with some isopropyl to give them a shot. They paired to my phone pretty seamlessly, as I’d expect from owning the 1st generation AirPods for years. The sound was good, but the advanced sound features did not work. You could not tell a difference when in noise suppression or noise transparency to even just having the features off. No difference at all. So I requested an exchange and sent that pair back.
Second pair was in a lot better shape than the first ones I was sent, so that was nice. Although the earbud tips still had earwax in them (seriously amazon, the least you could do is clean the damn used products you’re trying to resell). Anyway, same as the first set, they paired to my phone with no problems and the sound in them was fine. Still tho, none of the advanced sound features work. Again, I could not tell the difference between noise suppression, noise transparency or the features being off altogether. I’m sure it’s not my phone either, as I tried pairing them to my girlfriends phone as well, with the same results.
In the end, I requested to return for a full refund and I would rate the overall experience a 1/5 because of the gross ear tips and the exceptionally poor shape of the first pairs case.
If you’re planning to buy used from Amazon warehouse, just be aware that you may be getting a product in way worst condition than what’s advertised, with somebody else’s earwax in the AirPod tips and with critical features that don’t work. Which is probably why the original owner ended up selling them anyway.",2,2021-08-06,0

They're automatically on and always connected. AirPods can even sense when they're in your ears and pause when you take them out. You have the freedom to wear one or both AirPods, and you can play or skip forward with a double-tap when listening to music or podcasts.

I don’t know why the other reviewers said theirs were fake.
Pros: They are real genuine AirPods for a discounted price. The ones I received came with all contents in 100% condition. Nothing broke, stained, cracked or otherwise too dirty.
Cons: The reason someone returned it is because there’s a slight buzz in the left ear bud but it’s not noticeable when playing music unless it’s a bass heavy song/ sound.

Denita Smothers,1,UNSAFE- Airpods still connected to someone else;s icloud and FInd My location- No way to remove this,United States,1,"These airpods were still connected to someone else's iCloud email and Find My location. The only way to remove this, per Apple, is to have the OWNER remove their email from the airpods. Of course, this should have been handled prior to shipping this to anyone else. As soon as I connected the airpods to my iphone, the original owner had my location. I promptly called Apple to correct this and was notified it had to be done prior to sending the AirPods and the only person who could remove is the owner. THey advised me to turn it off immediately, disconnect it from my icloud, and send it back to Amazon as there is no way to stop it from sharing with the previous owner.
I am VERY disappointed by this oversight as this is a HUGE safety concern. Who knows who I shared my homes address with. So disappointed in this. Beyond disappointed actually.
Prior to sending this out, there needs to be more care taken to completely remove the original owner. They HAD to have gotten the same notification I did when they connected these AirPods to another device to test prior to sending. To send it out anyway is irresponsible and dangerous. It's a tracking device for God's sake.

Frederick C.,3,Almost there,United States,1,"The reason I say almost there, is because I must have a deformity in my right ear. The left ear bud can be placed in and will play for six hours plus without any complications. The right earbud falls out within two hours. I have to Believe the problem is with my earbuds rather than the earbuds because of having no difficulty with the left one. What really constitutes a problem is that I am a quadriplegic and you cannot just simply pick it up and place it back in your ear. It becomes a pain for more than me after happening to summon help.

Gab M,5,Almost Perfect!,United States,1,"I love these! I have been using them since i got them; sometimes not even for music just to drown out background noises.

The only thing I’m not too sure about; is the way the sleeves are connected. 3 times now I have taken out my earbuds and the sleeve (the squishy part that goes in your ear) was still in my ear. After taking the time to make sure they click in I haven’t had much issue. I have an Iphone so the connection is perfect every time.

The active noise cancellation is astounding I took many phone calls while biking on windy days or near busy streets and not once did they say they couldn't hear me over the wind or the cars. The one thing I don't like about them is the battery life of the charging case with my use I can only charge the earbuds twice with the case before I have to charge the case.

Recently, I've had issues with the airpods humming. One of the airpods will connect correctly and the other started humming in my ear and not playing any sound from my phone.

Lin B,5,As expected,United States,1,"I got these to replace my gen1 AirPods that I lost. Great upgrade, came like new even though it was “refurbished”. Glitches sometimes? My old ones did that too, idk why. Noise cancellation is astounding tbh. Don’t even have to start my music, as soon as I put them in I primarily if not only hear myself. Charges a little slower than gen1 to me, but battery lasts just as long. Don’t like that I have to really press them to skip and pause, gen1 was more of a tap which was a lot easier",0,2021-06-12,1
Kieva22,5,Perfect for the student stuck inside,United States,1,"I live with my parents and my grandmother. I have very little privacy and that’s a hindrance when it comes to studying. I have tried other noise canceling headphones but these work the best, and the ease to switch to ambient noise is smooth and easy so when my mom comes in to ask me a question I can hear her over my music.
The battery life is really nice as well. I was not expecting it to charge as fast as it did, and it keeps its charge really well. The wireless charging is great also! Be careful if you get a case for it however, some are to thick for the wireless charging!
TLDR: great battery, noise canceling and ambient settings rock. Great value! Weather you’re working out or studying they’re great! 10/10 would recommend",20,2020-05-07,1
Amber Jones,5,Love,United States,1,Not sure if there is a way to love a pair of ear pods more. I feel as if we may want to have have a few people at apple burned at the stake to see if they are witches and wizards working there with there technology of “noise cancelling”. Battery life is way more than what I need as I do not wear all day mainly when working in shop. If they die I have been working to long. Everything synced together perfectly and seamlessly.

DAN,3,Not what i expect from Apple.,United States,1,I have had these for almost a month now and can say they have issues. First is that sometimes the sensor on the stem does not always respond. At least once a week I must repair them cause they stop responding. In addition they lose sync if i am laying down and turn to the side. Not really sure why? They seem to fit fine but i can still hear outside noise all the time. I just really hoped for more from an apple product.

Nicolas Abreo,1,On top of giving me headphones that don't work they still have the previous owner account???,United States,1,"I received the headphones today. The headphones were charged, but the case was not. When I first paired them my phone said ""These are not your headphones"" And showed me part of the email of the previous owner. Then I was able to use them for 2 hours to then have to charge them. Turns out the case does not charge at all. I left them for 3 hours charging and they showed that they were at 100% then a second later being at 0% and dying again.
I basically lost 3 hours of my time trying to figure out how to unlink the old account. The name that pops up on the headphones literally says ""find my device"" as if I had stolen them.

Now about a month later both of the Airpods are having issues, they aren't connecting to my devices, and if they do end up connecting they will only stay connected for a couple seconds.

The left one when individually placed in box will pair and play in charging box, but refuses to remain connected once removed to use. As a set these refuse to work at all. Performed reset options on Apple website, nothing works. Product advertised as amazon tested and renewed. Seller questions suggest having Apple fix them at a repair location.

Nicolás Saldaña,1,"Bought one renewed, that wasn't renewed... bad experience.",United States,1,"When I put the right earpod it starts chirping very loudly, i'ts literally impossible to wear or try to listen something because the sound frequency its very high, probably i'll be deaf if wear the right airpod for more than 1-2 seconds.
On the video I posted i'm trying to replicate the ear cannal with my hands so you guys can listen the high frecuency sound.
I'm starting the refund process but honestly It's kinda rare, since renewed products supossedly are tested, cleaned, and other stuff... well this was not the case.
On top of that... I have to pay to send the item back to amazon... even if amazon refund the amount honestly it's just bad experience...
I guess that brand new airpods are great and all, maybe I had bad luck.

I reached out to the seller to return and it’s been 5 days with no response - previously, a return of this item was free and now the return costs $4.50. It’s not a huge amount of money but it’s enough to make me reach out to the seller and ask why it now costs $4.50 to return an item when it was previously free to make a return?

I charged and tried them (cringing at actually putting them in my ears, because ew) although I knew already I would return just to add info to this review. Even without the functional problem, these should not be sold as refurb's just with the extent of cosmetic damage. It looks as though a dog/cat or baby chewed on the AirPods themselves.

Mike,1,"You aren't saving money. These are scam products, not renewed or checked. Broken or fake.",United States,1,"Airpods could not stay paired for more than a few seconds. Guess the Amazon Renewed inspection lasts <5 seconds.
Right airpod did not work at all, dead in box. Guess the Amazon Renewed inspection only tested how they sound while muted.
Entire case and airpods were disgusting - earwax overload. Guess the Amazon Renewed inspection was done in a pitch black room.
Order ended up coming from ""Bargain Pc"". I'm refunding it. Nobody should ever consider business with them. A quick scan of their store page reveals them flooding ""Amazon Renewed"" with tons of reviews of broken or fake products. How they're still allowed to operate on Amazon is beyond me.",2,2021-02-14,0

These were the biggest pieces of you know what and without knowing the price you could say these are maybe 40$ max. Horrible sound quality. Outrageous price for renewed AirPod pros when you can get a brand new pair for under 130$. Also, how when these were renewed new audio supplements were put into the earbud. Not the original apple audio product but after market price of once again that maybe cost you 15$ to buy and build. When compared to AirPod pros from the apple store themselves, they sound so incredibly different it’s hilarious. Very poor effort, but at least you tried.",7,2020-11-25,0

It's unfortunate, I thought since it was renewed they would look over these earbuds. Apparently not. Also, the earbuds were named as, ""Bryan's Airpods Pro"". Kind of weird that they would keep that in and not reset it. The airpods themselves came covered in a white residue and the paint was chipping off of the case.

They were non-functional on arrival. They wouldn't turn on, and the case wouldn't charge.

Just about the only clean thing was the pods themselves, but I never got the chance to use them, for the reason I stated above. It may be that I ended up with a one-in-a-million fluke dud product, but judging by some of the other reviews I'm guessing that's not the case. Buyer beware!",2,2021-03-24,0

sophia henry,5,Best earbuds I have ever used!,United States,0,"I received this product as a gift and I was very excited to receive them.

It also features a noise cancelation setting and that is very helpful and adds to the sound quality as well. The battery life is 10/10 I can use my air pods for days and not need to charge them after every use. The actual air pods themselves are built well too, they have a rubber insert for the earbud that helps them stay in your ears and not fall out so they are perfect for working out.

Rashid,5,It's not what you think,United States,0,"A lot of people read it saying (refurbished) and move on and don't even consider buying it but let me tell you something. When a product is refurbished, especially apple products it doesn't mean its bad. When an item from apple is refurbished, it means that during scanning the machine detected something by mistake and when it does that it separates it into another line and basically it goes through a 2nd scanning. When they are refurbished, they just go through the scanning process a 2nd time and there's nothing wrong with that product. Apple may not tell you this so you pay more money for the one that does say ""refurbished"".",1,2020-09-22,1

Extremely disgusting and disappointed that the warehouse worker who inspected this couldn't even be bothered to reject it or try to sanitize it.

These specific model I couldn’t tell these were refurbished to be honest! They are clean and work perfectly and I have yet to kill the battery. I love it. I think I expected a bit more from the noise cancelling though but this is my first ever noise canceling device and I think I may need to try a different tip fit in my left ear versus my right ear.

These are so much better fitting/sounding than the original its incredible, I am not really a fan of the squeeze technic vs simply tapping but we'll see maybe that'll grow on me. If only Apple brought their manufacturing here to the USA thats the number 1 improvement needed at this point, but unlikely as of 2021...

Tessa M.,4,Almost Perfect!,United States,1,"I bought these refurbished Airpod Pros from the seller ""Certified Pre-Owned Computers"". I highly suggest you check the reviews for the seller you buy refurbished products from!! The Airpods Pros I purchased from this seller came in the original Apple box, with the Airpods case, Airpod Pros, lightning charging cable and the extra ear tips along with the Apple paperwork with no Apple stickers. I immediately checked to see if the serial numbers on the box and on the inside of the Airpods case matched up, and went to the Apple website to check if the serial number was actually authentic Apple Airpods. Good news: they ARE REAL Apple Airpod Pros! (There are A LOT of fake Airpods out there, so be careful!) The condition of the Airpod Pros and case were clean and almost like new. There is a very small tiny scratch on the side of the Airpods case, but it's very hard to see and basically unnoticeable. Other than that small blemish, the Airpods themselves work perfectly. All the batteries charge fully, and seem to last as long as they should. The firmware is up-to-date. The only downside to my purchase was that my package did not contain the SMALL Apple ear tips; instead I got 2 pairs of large ear tips and one pair of medium sized ear tips. Very unfortunate, but the medium work decent enough for me. Overall, besides the missing small ear tips, I'm very satisfied with the sound and function of my like-new Airpods Pros!",8,2021-01-04,1
Melissa Harris,1,Don’t buy from this company,United States,1,They sent me a pair of earbuds that didn’t even work at all. The sound was horrible with so much feedback. They wouldn’t even connect to my iPhone. When they did manage to connect it would only be for a few minutes. The case wouldn’t even pair. I bought another pair of “renewed” earbuds from a different seller and they came packaged beautifully with a charger included. These came in a ziploc bag with no charger. When I contacted them to have these things replaced they told me to go to the Apple store. So I did. Now the Apple store has had these earbuds for the past 2 weeks and they are still “diagnosing” them because when I was in store they failed every diagnostic test they ran so they had to send them off. Bought them almost a month ago and I still don’t have my earbuds just because this seller sold me a garbage product and then refused to just exchange them for a pair that works.,0,2021-06-26,0

Martin Garcia,5,Worked after getting a replacement,United States,1,"Update:
I decided to get a replacement and I sent back the faulty ones. They work great.
Old review:
I waited for a couple days to use a faulty product. That’s quite frustrating.
They’re clean and actually shiny. Yay.
Left AirPod charges whenever it wants to, but both AirPods won’t charge unless the case is being actively charged regardless of case percentage.
Case is faulty and opens and closes properly every other time.
Bluetooth has trouble connecting to iPhone in the sense that it connects yet doesn’t show up anywhere — nowhere to be seen in batteries widget nor connected devices after the >initial connection<, yet shows up as connected in Bluetooth settings. It doesn’t play the audio on AirPods, it actually has trouble connecting and makes your audio apps lag for some ungodly reason.
They show up on airplay but won’t connect.
Battery isn’t that great either, only lasts you 2-3 hours (mainly because it doesn’t even charge all the way without disconnecting.)
They sound “ok”.
They’ve been delivered for 4 hours and never worked properly.",2,2021-05-30,1

Abdullah,4,Excellent condition of item. Bad battery life and not value for money.,Canada,1,"The quality of the airpods pro is excellent! No scratches and almost brand new condition.
The only problem I have is that the refurbished airpods pro is not value for money. I can only get a maximum of 2.5 - 3 hrs of battery life before I need to charge again. This is not great, especially because I can pay $60 more and get 3x battery life on a brand new pair of original Airpods pro 2!!
If I am willing to splurge $271 for a refurbished product with such limited battery life, I might as well buy a brand-new pair of Airpods directly from Apple. I will be returning this product.

Los audífonos y todo lo que contenía parecen nuevos, no tienen ni un rasguño, lo único que no me gusto es que no tenían carga, pero, lo que me encantó fue que al revisar la vigencia de AppleCare descubrí que tenía cobertura de AppleCare+ por medio año.

Aunado a ello, he tenido buena experiencia con Amazon y con un vendedor con más de 97% de positividad, esto último es lo que deberían considerar antes de comprar a un proveedor ajeno a Amazon. En cuanto al equipo, es una chulada, buen audio, cómodos desde mi perspectiva, 4 horas de duración de batería que me parece justa porque no pasó tiempo prologando escuchando con los auriculares.

Solo hay dos detalles que me parecen importantes mencionarlos, el ensamblaje se nota, pero, he leído en varios blogs que los que están ensamblados en Vietnam no son los mejores ensamblajes, pero no afecta en nada el funcionamiento y solo se nota si los observas muy a detalle a una distancia tal vez de 5cm y la otra es que la caja de carga solo los carga al rededor de 3-4 veces de 0% a 100% de batería.

En mi caso todo bien, llego con una caja oficial de Apple y al verificar aún tenían una garantía de 6 meses, por lo que el tiempo de uso era realmente poco. Estéticamente los audífonos estaban increíbles, muy cuidados, de cualquier manera yo los limpie apenas los recibí por temas de higiene personal. La calidad de sonido y el audio espacial es impresionante, es por lo que quería estos Airpdos. Tengo también los AirPods 2 que adoro pero no cuentan con esta tecnología. Pero no todo podía ser bueno, me fallaron en lo que es un 90 % más importante para mi, la comodidad cosa totalmente subjetiva pero en mi caso fue imposible sentirme cómodo con ellos, las gomas lastimaban mis oídos y al final solo podía tenerlos entre 1 hora al día y ya. Me quedare con mis Aipords 2, que si siento cómodos y que a veces olvido que tengo puestos. Así que los recomiendo como compra, claro que si, se van a ahorrar un buen de dinero por un gran producto.

Xavier BC,5,Producto original con un precio inigualable,Mexico,1,"Decidí adquirir estos audífonos de AirPod Pro de Apple (modelo 2019), ya que anteriormente había adquirido unos audífonos reacondicionados AirPod (modelo 2017), los cuales, después de 4 años de vida útil empezaron a fallar, sin embargo, valió la inversión ya que solo invertí en ellos el valor del 50% en su momento (2018). De tal forma que ahora, he adquirido estos AirPods Pro al 50% del valor que actualmente ofrece Apple en su sitio oficial (abril 2022). De tal forma que quedé satisfecho con la primera inversión y por ello he decidido adquirir estos audífonos, los cuales llegaron en perfectas condiciones, con el empaque original, así como cable y las gomas en diferentes tamaños para ajustar los Airpods a los oídos.

• Primera impresión y desempaquetado: vinieron en caja original de Apple con instructivos y accesorios originales (cable de carga y los ear tips) empaquetados tal y como vienen en un producto nuevo. El estuche de carga no estaba envuelto pero si en perfecto estado, sin rayones, cada AirPod venía sin señales de uso y totalmente limpios.
• Experiencia de uso: conexión inmediata y estable con mi iPhone, sonido excelente, sin ruidos. Buena duración de la batería en reproducción de música y en llamadas. Probé los modos de ANC y transparencia y funcionan así como también lo de Audio Espacial y la verdad puedo decir que mi experiencia fue wow!

La calidad de audio es muy buena, que era lo que esperaba ya que venía de los sony wf…3, preferí estos solo por que me cambié a iPhone, y se integran muy bien con los demás dispositivos de apple: watch, ipad, mac.
Si regresara a Android me regresaría a los sony, en el idioma español prefiero google assistant o Alexa.
