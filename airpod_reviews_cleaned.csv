Allison,5,Skeptical at first but air pods all the way now,United States,1,"I have Been Vray Happy with My New-to-Me Air Pods Pro. I was skeptical at First About ‘Buying-In’ to The Air Pods Brand. For a long time and loved my not -apple brand ear Buds. These are awesome, and i am so happy and made the switch. The Noise Cancellation is a Really Cool Feature. I love that my music/Video Automatically Pauses If I Take One Airpod Out of My Ear. And being uble to interact with siri and talk-to-text is just so great, as a busy mm having tech that is Completely Hands-Free is awesome, and i don't have to have my phone in my pocket, it could be in the Next Room. I Went With The Pros Because The Shape of The Ear Bud Fits Better for Me. I have Never Liked The Fit of the Traditional Apple Ear Buds, They are not comforible for me. You are a better fit, Although I am Still Having Trouble With The Slipping out of My Ears, and I have tried changing out the different-sized cushions. This may be personnel issue, so I have experienced the Same Kind of slippage with other ear Buds. This product is great quality for the price. The Refurbished Air Pods Were Still Registered to Another User When the Package Arrived. However, My Husband Was Uble to Look Up How to do a Factory Reset, and that resolved the issue Easily In Minute.",24,2022-07-30,1

Wade Crawford,5,Best True-Wireless Headphones,United States,1,"I have Never Been An Apple Fan But Since Getting The Airpod Pro's, I am Committed! I have had Jaybird X2 or 3, Elite Sport Jabra, and have normal air pods in the past and was satisfied but in Hindsight, nothing really compares to the in -ar comfort, Sound Quality, and ease of use - plus the noise cancellation is impeccable! The Jaybirds Weren's True Wireless, The Jabra's Were Really Big and Had A Bit of Heft to Them, The Normal Air Pods were Ever-So-Slightly Uncomforable Due to The Size and They Don´t Have Noise Cancellation! 
 Note: I Have Been Using An iPhone For The Past 2 Years With An iPhone XS, Prior to That I Had Used Android Since The iPhone 5. I Try To Switch Every Few Years But Have Heard That It Works Great With Android, And I Can Confirm that they work Well Microsoft Computers For Teams, Zoom, and similar. 
 One Thing That I Will Say, Get A Case For Them, I GOT A Case for Mine But Unfortunately it Didn't Have The Pairing Hole, I used Low-Power Drill to Carefully Drill into the case and allow for pairing with a new Device, Without Remaving it from the case.

Alex Joy,4,Pretty Good!,United States,1,"Sound Quality Is Average at Best and Hollow at Worst. It’s passable for Everyday usage which is What i Needed However I Really Truly Want to listen to Play to Music I Wouledn’t UseSe these. The Noise Canceling Misses A Lot The Higher and Louder Noises/Sounds. The Sony WFXM What’s Are Far and Away Better at Both Noise Canceling and Sound Quality. The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1S Are Even Better At Sound But Don’t Feature Noise Canceling. WHERE THE AIRPOD PROS BeAT Both of them, and WHY I Like Them The Most, is General Ease of Use. They Connect Instantly and When I want to go one bud it doesn’t skip a Beat. The Case in the Perfect Size and Shape for Wireless Earbuds. They look the best in my opinion. No One Will Start Talking You Because They Couldn’t See Your Earbuds which is a Hage Deal for Me! I Love Being Uble to Easily See The Battery Life, Which is a bit low but Totally Fine, On Them when they connect too white is absent from the other mentioned Buds. As Far as Price Goes Those I’d Only Considers Buying these When they’re on Sale or Refurbished as for $ 250 they are not worth it. I PURCHASED THROCH Amazon Renewed at $ 169 Which I Think Was A Great Deal. For Comparison The Sony’s are about $ 220 IIRC and the Cambridge Audios $ 99.

The Buds Go Right in No Falling Out and They Are Kind of Hard To Get The Tips Off, So You Won’t Lose Them. They Give You A Couple Tips For Sizes. 
 Now Let’s Talk About Sound ..10 .. Nice Bass and Clarity and They Let You Hear People While Listening to Music, You Can Hear Around You. But go i say this for the people that liste to music like i do, full blast, probablay be deaf when i Get Older, but i don´t care what they say about you hear everyday, no .. so you can hear alittle when when Your Music Is Full Blast May A Peep. But if you keep you music at medium Level and are in College, You Can Hear Your Teacher Talk While Listen to Music. Just Focus .. Lol 
 Also, Another Note. CHARGING DOC OR CASE. It great for charging than you are out in about. Also I Sub Times Like To Use Just 1 At A Time Due to I liste to Loud Music, So it charges one at a time, you don't hav to charge bot and i like how your phone state's battery life of Bud and Charger/ doc.",0,2021-05-13,1

Skyler Beatty,5,Money Well Spent,United States,1,"I was hesitant to purchase The Airpod Pros at First, but as Soon Began to use them, I realized it was a Worthy Investment. I use them almost everyday, and they make my life a lot of more exciting. As a College Student, I Wear Them Walking Across Campus While I Listen to Upbeat Music in Between Stressful Classses. I Will Put Them in My Ears and Turn On a Song, and It Makes Me Feel Like I Am In a Movie. They help to put my mind at ease and unwind. The Noise-Cancelling Feature is mind-bogling given the size and comfort compared to other noise-challeling headphones. I have Shown My Grandparents, and They Were In Awe of the Quality of Sound and Comfort.

Dylan,3,Not Clean,United States,1,Over All The Air Pods Work Definitely and Got Them Renewed in “Excellent” Quality. WHEN I ORDER THAT I EXPECT TO BARELY BE ABLE TO TELL THAT they have out of the Box Before Or Maybe Have Been used one or twice. WHEN I GOT MINE The First Thing I Noticped Was The Outside Was Sticky. As if there was an adhesive from a prior prior sticker. That was annoying definitely but the worst part was when i opened the air pods and looked at One and Inside The Ear Bud There Was Ear Wax…. There Was Also Ear Wax in the Bottom of the Holders for The Ear Buds. Over all i am disappointed and disgusting. I did a Deep Clean myself and i hope no one else you have to clean out Strangers Ear Wax.,2,2022-08-09,0
Amazon Customer,3,Vary Cheap Airpods. PROBLEMS AFTER 6 months,United States,1,"They work great. And for Being Refurbished Were A Steal for High Quality Airpods. I GOT THEM FOR Under $ 100 at The Time. 
 But After 6 months, The Right-Meet Airpod Stopped Working Entirely. I DID SUB TROUBLASHOOTING with Apple Support. Long Story Short, Because they were out of the Apple 1 Year Warranty, Insttead of Paying for 1 Replacement Airpod - Subject Hing Like $ 85 - I Would have to replace All 3 Devices (2 Airpods and the Charging Case) for $ 257. That Costs More than A Brand New Set of Airpod Pros. 
 So, You get what you pay for i guess. I had high qualy Airpods for Half the Price for 6 months. Now i Just have 1. i'll keep using it unnile the left-side one malfuncctions. It all balances out i Suppos. But Next Time I'll Be Getting Them Brand New and with The Extended Warranty.",1,2022-07-12,0

I Don't Use Them Often So i was Surprised to Discover This Problem So Soon. Another Few Months of Use and Now I'M Discovering More Problems Like A Lot of Static and the Sound On The Left Pod Going In and Out. What's More Surprising is the fact that I boought to replace Cheaper Pair of Non-Apple Air Pods That Actually Worked Better. I Paid Apple Prices But Got Cheap Quality. Never Buy Refurbished Again.

Fernando,1,"UPDATED REVIEW - DECENT PRODUCT, HORRIBLE SELLER",United States,1,"Would Like To Clarify - The Initial Review was 5 stars and still holds up with regards to the product itself, but the new 1 Star Review is due to a a feto. For Starters, The Initial Pair of Airpods Ceased to Play Audio On The Left Side, Feet Charging Overnight and Several Remarts. 'No Big Deal, I'll Send Them Back for a replacement', I Thought. I DID, and Today and I prescribed to 'replacement' consisting of an empty airpod pro box. Do not marry, not obvious Tamper Protection (The Initial Pair Had Tape On The Box, This Had Absolute Nothing So Clearly Subsone Had Already Rifled Through It) - Absolutely Pathettic Showing. I PURCHASED THIS REFURBISHED PAIR From 'A4C Online' and Would Like to Tell Anyone Looking at This Review Now To Stay Away From Them. The Text of the Initial Review Has Been Preserved Below for posterity and scholause I Still Agree That the Airpods Themselves are an excellent product; But do Yourself in favor and Buy from Subsone Else, Specifically Apple Directly if you can afford the extra cost. 
 ----------------------- 
 Bought for My are to replace Pair of Airpod 1s He had for two years which Stopped Holding A Charge on Right Earbud, I'll Let Him Write This Review. 
 'I'm typically not an apple person. In Fact, i'm Literally using these on a Samsung Phone. I've Always Taken Apple Products To Be Shoddy or Lower To OTher Brands, But usually More Expensive Due to The Brand Recognition. I GOT A Pair of Original Airpods for Free from a Friend Who'd Upgraded, So I Figured I Might As Well Use Them. They served well for a coupling yars but had a lot of minor flaws that st ” Hours? Could Just Be Scholause they were used, but still), Really Poor Build Quality, Unintuitive Controls for Playing, Pausing, etc. These solve everym I had, and honestly blek mind. The Quality is a Noticable Step Up - Not Incredible, But Definitely More than You'd Expect From earbuds of This Size. They Fit Vray Snugly in the Ears and Don't Fall Out Easily at All. The Anc Noise Cancellation Is Amazing, You Literally Can't Hear Any Other Background Noises. The Battery Life Is Long and i'm Still Not Sure How Long It Lasts, I HadSe On and Playing for At Least 3 Or 4 Hours and I Didn't Even Get A Low Battery Warning. Since we got before at a bit of a discount (Roughly $ 168 Due toSe Being Renewed), I am Absolutely 100% Happy With The Price to Quality Ratio. $ 200 For Them Direct from Apple is a bit, but $ 150- $ 170 is a Good Price. You Will Not Regret Buying to Pair of Airpod Pros! '",4,2021-10-02,0

Logan,1,PRODUCT ARRIVED DEFETING!,United States,1,"I’m familiar with This Product, as these are my 7th pair. (My Job causes me to lise/ Leave my Airpods All The Time.) 
 However, This is the first time I’ve Ever Purchaseed to Used/ Refurbished/ Renewed Pair. But since I lases Them All The Time, I Thought It May Be a Cost Effective Option for Me. Unfortunately, my device was defective out of the box! 
 ** Story Time ** 
 My Airpods Pro Didn’t Come with All Of The Materials That Come In The Original Box and The Charger I Received [Package Separately] Was Not Even An Apple Brand. This Didn’t Bother ME MUAN, so I have more than covech accessories for this item. 
 The Device Itself Appeared Clean and undamaged. When I Opened The Device to Check The Battery Status, It Was Dead [Apple Has A Policy of Not Sending their devices Fully Charged for Shipping Safety Reasons, So i Assumed The Previous Owner Received the item new and return Them Without Charging It More]. 
 I connected the airpods to my office Apple Charger from a prior device and the Battery Light immedialy Glowed Green. Confused, and The proceeded to pair it to my phone. The first attempt was Successful. I Checked My Battery Notification Screen On My iPhone and the Airpods Case Displayed A Full 100% Charge, Yet The Airpods Themselves were Each Dead AT 1%. After Few Seconds of Charge, They rear 7% [Charging Speed Rare, But Not Completely Unheard of], So I Took The Case Off the Charger and Went To Test Out The Sound Quality. 
 So so i took an earpiece out- The Entire Device Went Off. The Case and Pods Still Read as Charging On My Phone Even Though I Had Removed Them From Charging Moments Before. I COULD NOT FIND THE DEVISE IN MY DROP MENU, SO I WENT INTO SETTITINS TO MANUALLY PAIR THE AIRPODS AGAIN-SY WOOLDN’T SYNC. After 4/5 Times Connecting and Forgetting Device, I attempted to reattach the charger- now the Airpods case is on 0% But the Earpieces are Both on 13% 🙄. As Ion I Plug Them Back in, The Airpods Sync Again and I Able to Hear The Pairing Chime On My Earpiece. Seconds Later The Airpods Die and The Phone Shows they are on 0% * Charging * While they are still in my Ears! 
 Like I Said, I’ve had a ton of airpods, I know how to trubleshot Most any problem they give me. I’ve Never to deal with This Kind of Headache Before- specially on Day 1. i’m so over it! I’m Going to an Apple Store First Thing in the Morning. This was a horrible experience.",7,2021-09-26,0

Bernard K Hurley,2,Don’t Purchase ‘Renewed’ Airpods,United States,1,"I listen to podcasts and audiobooks. As Such, I’ve Purchaseed Many Earbuds Over The Last 10 Years, Most of Which were <$ 100. Wanting A Durable Earbud with Good Audio (particularly for Making / Recenting Calls), I Finally Chose The Apple Pro. To Save Money i Chose a ‘Renewed’ Apple Product. 
 I Made My Purchase on Nov 19, and Have Been Vray Content with the Quality - So so so that decided to Order Another Pair for My Wife on Dec 8. However, On Dec 9 I Began Having Connection Problems With My Earbuds. So i decided to do what i summes do with amazon, and decide to exchange. This is When I Discovered The Pitfalls of Buying a ‘Renewed’ Apple Product. 
 First, Unlike Most Amazon Purchasses, There is no return / Exchange Option for Renewed Apple Earpods. There Is, However, Bureaucracy. After Closer Look at My Options and an Hour On The Phone With Amazon and Apple, I Discovered That My Earbud Warranty (With The Sell) Expired on Dec 10. My Only Option Was To Send the Buds to Apple for Repair. 
 I immedialy decided to cancel my second Amazon (Earbud) Order. However, Just Like My First Order, There Was No Cancel Option for The Second Earbuds. They were in the mail. I Received Them The Next Day. 
 At This Time I Have Initiedated Returns Through Customer Service and I’m Waiting for Follow Up Via Amazon. I Will Modify This Review Accordingly. 
 The Lesson, If you want Apple Earpods, Buy New.",0,2021-12-12,0

outofethers,1,Dirty and Noise Transparency Does Not Work,United States,1,"So i was Willing to Give these A Shot Because of the Money i’d Save Combase To Buying New Ones. 
 The First Pair I Got Was Nasty. The Case Was So Scuffed and Dirty, Opening The Case and Looking at the Buds You Could See Ear Wax Inside The Tips. Really, Really Gross. DEFINITELY NOT “GOOD” CONDITION AND DEFINITELY NOT Worth The 192 Dollar Price Tag. Nevertheless, I Cleaned Them with Sub isopropyl to Give Them A Shot. They Paired to My Phone Pretty Seamlessly, as I’d Expect from Owning The 1st Generation Airpods For Years. The Sound Was Good, But the Advanced Sound Features Did Not Work. You could not Tell a Difference When in Noise Sobpression or Noise Transparency to Even Just Having The Features Off. Do not differentiate at all. So i cid an exchange and feel that pair back. 
 Second Pair was in a Lot Better Shape Than The First Yours I Was Sent, So That Was Nice. Although The Earbud Tips Still Had Earwax in Them (Serioususly Amazon, The Least You Could do is clean the damn used production you’re Trying to Resell). Anyway, Same as The First Set, They Paired to My Phone With No Problems and the Sound in Them Was Fine. Still Tho, None of the Advanced Sound Features Work. Again, I Could Not Tell The Difference Between Noise Sobpression, Noise Transparency or The Features Being Off Altogether. I’m Sure It’s not My Phone Eithher, as I tried pairing them to my girlfriends phone as Well, with the Same Results. 
 In the end, I clock to return for a full refund and i would rate the overall experience at 1/5 Best of the Gross Ear Tips and the Exceptionally Poor Shape of the First Pairs Case. 
 If you’re planning to buy used from Amazon Warehouse, Just Be Aware that you may be getting a product in Way Worsst Condition than what’s advertise, with topody else’s earwax in the airpod tips and with critical features that Don’t work. WHICH IS PROBLY WHY THE ORIGINAL OWNED UP Selling Them Anyway.",2,2021-08-06,0

Not the original Apple Audio Product But After Market Price of Once Again That Maybe Cost You $ 15 To Buy and Build.

You are spectific model i couldn’t Tell before were refurbished to be honest! They are clean and work perfectly and i have yet to kill the battery. I love it. I Think I Expected Bit More From The Noise Cancelling Though Butis Is My First Ever Noise Canceling Device and I Think I May Need to Try A Different Tip Fit in My Left Ear versus my right. Or maybe A Comple Foam Tip for a Different Fit. As I summed the fit is a bit loser than the original Airpods We’re.

Tessa M.,4,ALMOST PERFECT!,United States,1,"I boought before Refurbished Airpod Pros from The Seller ""Certified Pre-Owned Computers"". I Highly Suggest You Check The Reviews for The Seller You Buy Refurbished Products From !! The Airpods Pros I Purchaseed From This Seller Came in the original Apple Box, with the Airpods Case, Airpod Pros, Lightning Charging Cable and The Extra Ear Tips Along With The Apple Paperwork With No Apple Stickers. I immedialy Checked to see if the serial numbers on the box and on the inside of the airpods case matched up, and went to the apple website to check if the serial Number was the news Authentic Apple Airpods. Good News: They are Real Apple Airpod Pros! (There are a Lot of Fake Airpods out there, so be careful!) The condition of the airpod pros and case were clean and almost like new. There is a Vary Small Tiny Scratch on the Side of the Airpods Case, But It's Very Hard to See and Basically Unnoticable. Oher Than That Small Blemish, The Airpods Themselves Work Perfectly. All The Batteries Charge Fully, and sem to last as Long as they should. The Firmware IS Up-to-Date. The Only Downside to My Purchase was that my package did not count the Small Apple Ear Tips; INSERED I GOT 2 PANS OF LARGE EAR TIPS AND ONE PAIR OF MEDIUM SIZED EAR TIPS. Vary Unfortunate, but the medium work dates engough for me. Overall, Besides The Missing Small Ear Tips, I'M VERY satisfied with the sound and function of my Like-New Airpods pros!",8,2021-01-04,1

In my case, everything was fine, I arrived with an official Apple box and when verifying they still had a 6 -month guarantee, so the time of use was really little. Aesthetically the headphones were incredible, very careful, in any way I cleaned them as soon as I received them for personal hygiene issues. Sound quality and space audio is impressive, it is why these airpids wanted. I also have the Airpods 2 that I adore but do not have this technology. But not everything could be good, they failed me in what is 90 % more important for me, the comfortable thing totally subjective but in my case it was impossible to feel comfortable with them, the tires hurt my ears and in the end I could only have them between 1 hour a day and now. I will stay with my Aipords 2, that if I feel comfortable and that sometimes I forget that I have positions. So I recommend them as a purchase, of course, they will save a good money for a large product. But in comfort issues because if the hearing aids of this type are theirs I do not think they have problems.",16,2021-09-10,1
Javier Everardo Arechiga Dueñas,5,Impeccable,Mexico,1,"Who has never had the opportunity to use Pro headphones, let me tell them that they are worth it. 
 The cancellation of noise, the environment mode, the comfort of linking all the devices without doing anything and that the music/audio is heard very beautiful is worth the expense 
 I do not regret having bought them “reconditioned” because they came with the best quality and without any complaint. If you do not have the money to buy them new, this option comes great 😋",0,2022-09-18,1
Xavier BC,5,Original product with an unmatched price,Mexico,1,"I decided to acquire these Airpod Pro headphones from Apple (2019 model), since I had previously acquired airpod reconditioned headphones (2017 model), which, after 4 years of useful life, began to fail, however, it was worth the investment since I only invest in them the value of 50% at the time (2018). In such a way that now, I have acquired these Airpods Pro at 50% of the value that Apple currently offers in its official site (April 2022). In such a way that I was satisfied with the first investment and therefore I have decided to acquire these headphones, which arrived in perfect condition, with the original packaging, as well as cable and the rubber in different sizes to adjust the airpods to the ears. I barely have a few weeks of use and I have been satisfied with the acquisition. In case of any change, I will update this review. Recommendation: If you have a chance, review, analyze and compare and it is worth acquiring the remanufactured products in the Amazon Renewed store.",1,2022-04-24,1

Jose Paoli,5,"I am totally satisfied, they seem new",Mexico,1,"I had read a mix of opinions, good and bad and I was about to bow for some totally new ones but in the end I ended up buying these renewed and the truth is that I am positively impressed: 
 • First impression and unpacked: They came in original Apple box with original instructions and accessories (load cable and the EAR tips) packaged as they come in a new product. The load case was not wrapped but in perfect condition, without rayons, each airpod came without use signs and totally clean. 
 • Use experience: immediate and stable connection with my iPhone, excellent sound, without noise. Good battery life in music and call reproduction. I tried anc and transparency modes and work as well as space audio and I really can tell my experience was wow!

JuanMMO,1,I bought the Buyspry store reconditioned,Mexico,1,I bought it reconditioned to save me some cents and trusting that it would serve perfectly. When the product arrived it was well packed and in its original box but when I tried them the right headset produced a white noise and sounds strange when playing sound. I think buying reconditioned is like throwing a coin into the air. Fortunately Amazon has good customer service and could solve the problem.,5,2021-10-21,0

Ignacio Diaz,1,"They don't buy, you can't return if it doesn't work",Mexico,1,"Buy these headphones because they supposedly have the Amazon Renewed guarantee, which says that for any inconvenience you can return. I've been talking with Amazon agents, because the seller or where to find it, and everyone tells me that this product is returnable. Even when the publication clearly says otherwise.
